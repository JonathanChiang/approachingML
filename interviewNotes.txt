BUILDING A MODEL: 


	- Predict ETA after Ride Request:
		- 1,000,000 riders in seattle: 
		- How do we know we have enough data: 
		
			- What I think of: 

			- Solution: 
				- Product Goal:
					- Accuracy? 
					- Reasonable? 
				- How to evaluate a model: 
					- Feature Set to Training size Ratio: 
						- too many
							- overfitting 
							- inaccuracy: 
					- Why do too many featuers lead to overfitting and inaccuracy?
						- bigger dimension space
						- fitting your parameters to the training data 
						- find noise in training data 
						- perform well on training but bad on test data 
					- Baseline Models: 
						- help us choose to increase data or increase feature set: 
						- looking at accuracy while increasing data points (trends)
						- if collect more data doesn't improve model:
							then we need better features 


	- Detecting Fraud: 


		- What is an imbalanced dataset? 
			- different classes ratio too different

		- What is accurate data in fraud models? 

		- How do you interpret a model for fraud? 

		- What happens when you predict wrong and how do you deal with it? 

		- What is low recall mean? 
			- too many false negatives 
			- banks loses money to fraud

		- What is low precision? 
			- too many false positives 
			- bad customer experience 
			- we think every transaction is fraud 

		- Why are precision recall curve important here? 

		- What are some good algorithms to deal with reweighing data? 

		- What are good ways to deal with different costs of transactions? 

		- What is smote? 
			- synthetic minority oversampling technique
			- randomly undersample overclassed 
			- randomly generate synthetic minority using SMOTE 


	- Food Delivery Times: 

		- Food prep times at restaurants? 
			- continuous so use regression 

		- Why is bias important here? 
			- food prep times versus predicted times 
			- expected versus measured = bias in regression 

			- What does being wrong here mean for business? 
				- Cold food (delivery person is late model predicts late times) 
				- Delivery person is waiting (model predicts low times)


	- Search Algorithm Recall 

		 - Without changing the algorithm:  

			 - How do you improve product search? 

			 - How do you increase recall? 
			 	
			 	- What is recall? 
			 		 - proportion correct 

			 	- Collaboratie Filtering 
			 		- products use to be bought together 


	- Booking Regression 

		 - Predict Prices on Airbnb
